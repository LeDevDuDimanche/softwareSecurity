The commands API works in the following. Every function takes in a reference to a connection object, does some parsing or system commands 
and then send either an output or an error depending on what happened. A connection object is thought of as an object that describes the state of a connection
at a given point. The connection object describes the state of a connections, for example who is the user corresponding to this connection 
and in what directory is the user at a given point in time. To summarize, the connection object is passed as a reference to the commands
API and then it modifies the state of the connection. 

Connection object:
    The connection object has a few instance variables.
    The user variable is very straightforward and corresponds to the user associated with the connection. 
    The baseDir variable corresponds to the base directory where all users(or in theory a group of users) host their shared files and directories.
    The currentDir variable corresponds to the directory, relative to the base directory, the user is located at currently.
    The UsereReadTable is a pointer to an instance of a UserReadTable object. It is important that all the users have a pointer to the same instance of the object since this is used to synchronize their activities.
    The FileDeleteTable is a pointer to an instance of a FileDeleteTable object. It is important that all connections have a pointer that points to the same instance since this is used to synchronize the active connections.

FileDeleteTable:
    Used to synchronize different connections. Deleting a file or directory may take a while and such a user could be able to enter the directory
    while it is being removed. To avoid this, this is used so when starting to delete a  file/directory, it is logged here and the consequently removed the rm command finished
UserReadTable:
    Used to synchronize different connections. This is used when a user enters a directory, the directory and all of its parent directories are all marked as being read 
    so that different users can not delete a file/directory while it is being accessed.
